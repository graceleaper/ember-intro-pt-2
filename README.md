## Notes

- Create a new model (which will be generated in the 'models' directory):
`ember g model car`
- Keep model names singular
- Create a controller (which will create cars.js in the controllers directory):
`ember g controllers cars`
- Remember, we use controllers for events and actions
- We're going to use the default Rest Adapter
- Create an 'adapter' folder in the 'app' directory
- Create 'application.js' (application adaptor) in the 'adapter' folder
